```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# Load all your packages here:
library(tidyverse)
library(GGally)
library(rpart)

# Set default behavior for all code chunks here:
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
  fig.width = 16/2, fig.height = 9/2
)

# Set seed value of random number generator here. This is in order to get
# "replicable" randomness, so that any results based on random sampling or
# resampling are replicable everytime you knit this file. Why use a seed value
# of 76? For no other reason than 76 is one of my favorite numbers:

set.seed(76)
```

You will be fitting CART models to the data from the [Ghouls, Goblins, and Ghosts... Boo!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ghouls-goblins-and-ghosts-boo/){target="_blank"} Kaggle competition. The competition's score for leaderboard purposes is the "Categorization Accuracy". However you will **NOT** be making any submissions to Kaggle.

# Load data

Read in data provided by Kaggle for this competition. They are organized in the `data/` folder of this RStudio project:

```{r}
training <- read_csv("data/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("data/test.csv")
sample_submission <- read_csv("data/sample_submission.csv")
```


## Look at your data!

Always, ALWAYS, **ALWAYS** start by looking at your raw data. This gives you visual sense of what information you have to help build your predictive models. To get a full description of each variable, read the data dictionary in the `data_description.txt` file in the `data/` folder.

Note that the following code chunk has `eval = FALSE` meaning "don't evaluate this chunk with knitting" because `.Rmd` files won't knit if they include a `View()`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(training)
glimpse(training)

View(test)
glimpse(test)
```

In particular, pay close attention to the variables and variable types in the
`sample_submission.csv`. Your submission must match this exactly.

```{r}
glimpse(sample_submission)
```

# Minimally viable product

Perform the following exploratory data analyses:

## Univariate explorations

**Categorical predictor**: Create a visualization of the categorical predictor variable `color`.

```{r}

```


**Outcome variable**: Create a visualization of the categorical predictor variable `type`.

```{r}

```


## Mutlivariate explorations

**Numerical predictors**: Create a visualization of the relationship of all four numerical predictor variables at once (`bone_length`, `rotting_flesh`, `hair_length`, `has_soul`) using the `ggpairs()` function from the `GGally` [package](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/#ggallyggpairs). 

```{r}

```

**Relationship of categorical predictor and outcome variable**: Create a visualization of the relationship between the categorical outcome variable `type` and any predictor varible of your choosing.

# Due diligence

1. Fit a CART where:
    * You use only the numerical predictors.
    * The maximum depth of the tree is 5.
    * You use the default "complexity parameter" 
1. Plot the tree.
1. Make predictions `type_hat` on the `training` data. Hint compare the output of `predict(model_CART, type = "prob")` and `predict(model_CART, type = "class")`.
1. Compute the "classification accuracy".

```{r, fig.height = 9, fig.width=16}

```




***



# Reaching for the stars

Note that the $\alpha$ complexity parameter is the `cp` argument to `rpart.control()`.

1. Reusing the MP1 solutions code, for the range of `alpha` complexity parameters in the `alpha_df` data frame, return an estimate of the accuracy/error that Kaggle would return.
1. Plot the relationship between the alpha complexity parameter and accuracy.
1. Using the optimal $\alpha^*$ complexity parameter, write a `submission.csv` suitable for submission to Kaggle.

```{r}
alpha_df <- tibble(
  alpha = seq(from = 0, to = 0.05, length = 100),
  accuracy = 0
)
set.seed(76)

```

# Point of diminishing returns

* Use one-hot-enconding to fit a predictive CART model using the categorical variable `color` and plot the tree. Set the maximum depth of the tree to 5 and use the default "complexity parameter".
* No need to generate an estimate of the accuracy that Kaggle would return.
